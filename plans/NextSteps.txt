This file maintains a list of things to do for the project and what should  be done first.



1) Create a state-representation of the halite game. 

2) Get debugging information out of the bots. These are run in command line and relieable debugging information have to be logged properly for analysis.

3) What prediction system should we try to implement. Some people say, that neural nets can take to long for a prediction. We therefore must be carefull how we fill the gpu with data.

4) Create a reinforcement environment where different algorithms can be made exchangable.
